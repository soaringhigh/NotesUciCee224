This scriptum is based on the notes taken in the lecture CEE224A Transportation Data Analysis I by Professor Jean-Daniel Saphores, held at the Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California in Irvine in the winter quarter 2019. This course is designed as an introduction to statistical and econometric tools for analyzing datasets for applications in the field of transportation science. It is a graduate level course with basic knowledge of probability and statistics as prerequisites. The lecture is on based on the literature recommended. The notes have been extended with further information, references and explanatory figures. Even though this notes have been gleaned with utmost care by Jens Frische, it is highly unlikely that there are no mistakes in this script. If you are aware of one or want to extend the scope further, please help yourself and others by adding your knowledge :)
